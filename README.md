### What is Insurance?
A contract in which an individual or entity pays an insurance company in exchange for financial protection or reimbursement of losses resulting from a covered event.
How does it work?
The insurance company takes the risk of the insured person and for such “risk management,” cost is required for an insurance company.

The cost of risk is spread across a large group of people who share the similar risks.

When you buy an insurance policy, you transfer your risk to the insurance company. In exchange for this risk, you pay a premium to the company.

This, in turn, will create a big pool of funding, which will be used to cover the claim in case of occurrence of any unexpected event in anyone’s life.

After the claim acceptance, the insurer will assist to settle down the claim after the concerned process and verification.

## What is Insurance Fraud?
Insurance fraud is when someone does something dishonestly (or doesn’t do something they should do under their policy) to try and illegally benefit in a way that they’re not entitled to. Any act or omission made with dishonest or illegal intent, to obtain a benefit or advantage, is considered fraudulent.

Most insurance fraud occurs at claim time, including:

exagerated claims
events/losses that didn’t happen
staged losses – for example vehicle theft, Crashing on purpose.
In addition, a large number of fraudulent claims occur through non-disclosure of information that insurers require, in order to match the correct premium to the risk.

Insurance Fraud in New Zealand
In 2019 general insurance fraud in New Zealand was estimate to have cost policyholders over $688 million. That means that every year, honest New Zealanders are paying to cover other people’s fraudulent claims.

The estimated cost of insurance fraud to all policyholders this year: 580,000,000 [ still going up ]

How does this affect you?
The cost of insurance fraud isn’t limited to claim values. Insurance fraud increases insurers’ operating costs through additional time, staff and investigation. These costs also need to be passed on to consumers.

The larger the size of the dishonest claim, the more everyone ends up paying.

## Business Context
Currently insurance claims are coming in at an increasing rate. Investigating each claim to see if it is legitimate is very time consuming. If the illegitimate claim slips to the vetting process that will lead to loss for the company and the customers. The more loss that occurs the more the company will have to charge it’s customers, which leads to a decrease in customer dissatisfaction.

What if we can implement a model that can predict which claims are fraud?

This would increase efficiency for the claims process and would reduce the amount of additional time, staff and investigation. Also decrease the amount of capital lost. In turn this would benifit the companys customer retention and profits. Potentially help reduce premuims

## Business Question:
Can we predict which claims will be reported as fraud?

Can we minimise the loss made from fraud?

What trends does the data show that leads to fraud? - Red Flags

We can implement Machine Learning Model to predict which claims should be investigated further for fraud

Where would the company implement this?
This Machine Learning Model would come in when the claim is filed as long as we have all the required information we should be able to predict which claims are fraud.
What it could help with:

Highlight claims that would need to be focused on.
Increase in claims processing efficiency
Pick out trends that highlight fraud
